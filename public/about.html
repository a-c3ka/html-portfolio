<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Artan, a 17-year-old from North Macedonia.
  Currently, I am a student at Gymnasium, and my hobbies are playing guitar and gym.
</p>

<p>From an early age, I felt an undeniable connection to music, particularly the guitar. 
I went in a musical school for 6 years, and through countless hours of practice and dedication, 
I've developed my skills for playing guitar.</p>

<p>In addition to my musical journey, I find great solace in maintaining an active lifestyle. 
  Fitness has become an integral part of my daily routine, not only for physical well-being but also for the mental clarity and discipline. 
  The gym has become a place where I can push my limits, challenge myself, and emerge stronger than before.</p>
